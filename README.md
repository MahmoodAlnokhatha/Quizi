## How it works
#### The game is developed based on two main elements, which are obstacles **(lightning)** and a spaceman **(Quizi)**. The user must make sure to avoid all the lightning elements that will be generated automatically until he passes 20 elements to win!

## How to play
#### The game can be interacted with by pressing the _Start_ button and then using only the Keyboard keys:
* Use the up arrow button to move the Quizi up.
* Use the down arrow button to move the Quizi down.

## Highlights
#### ðŸ§± Padding utlization in JS
Padding in JavaScript is used to create safe space around Quizi to prevent early collision detection with Lightning.

return !(
  (r1.top + padding) > (r2.bottom - padding) ||
  ...
);
```
